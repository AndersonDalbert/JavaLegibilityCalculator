# JavaReadabilityCalculator

A calculator based on my research of the SRES metric applied in measuring Java code legibility.
It takes a repository path and outputs the project readability value. This value is calculated by using an algorithm based on HÃ¶rstler arcticle and uses a Java tool developed by Katyusco Santos, "VocabularyTool" for extracting tokens from code.
